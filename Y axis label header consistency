Fix the Y-Axis Header Area in Tableau:
Option 1: Manually resize and lock the header

In your worksheet, hover over the row header divider (between the axis header and the chart).

When the resize cursor appears (↔), drag it to set a consistent width.

Tableau will remember the size unless something forces it to resize (like new longer labels).

If used in a dashboard:

Add the sheet to a container.

Fix the container size so the axis doesn’t get squeezed or stretched.

✅ Best for: Simple cases where you just need consistent alignment across sheets

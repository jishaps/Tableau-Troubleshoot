A dashboard can only be shared as image or pdf eventhough it is a tabular report
If multiple tabular dashbaords present, we have to download one by one; not all at the same time
Some other type of reporting tool, filter the data first and then pull from database but in tableau model we have to pull the data first
Table worksheet is not flexible. All the measures should be at the end
Excel has a feature to add the contents of multiple sheets to a new worksheet but that is not easy with Tableau (Tableau extentions is one option)
Show and hide filters or worksheets are not easy to handle (needs some time of development)
export excel from tableau desktop takes time
For analysis we need to download excel csv file, that requires publish the report first and then download
waterfall or donut charts are not builtin
Adding text headers is not easy

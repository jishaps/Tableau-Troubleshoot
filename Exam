Tableau can aggregate dimension
blue pill descrete, green pill continuous. Continuous (green) pills will always form an axis!
When we drag a measure to the view, the aggregation applied by default is NOT always SUM (Whenever you add a measure to your view, an aggregation is applied to that measure by default. The type of aggregation applied varies depending on the context of the view)
We can disaggregate the data, to see all of the marks in the view at the most detailed level of granularity
A bar chart is best used to compare data across categories
Generally, the easiest way to convert a bar chart to a stacked bar chart is to drag a dimension to Color on the marks card

Is SUM a table calculation? No (SUM is an aggregate function, not a table calculation! A table calculation is a transformation you apply to the values in a visualization. Table calculations are a special type of calculated field that computes on the local data in Tableau. They are calculated based on what is currently in the visualization and do not consider any measures or dimensions that are filtered out of the visualization. The most common Table calculations are: Running Total, Percent Difference, Difference, Percent of Total, Rank, and Percentile.)

What would the following expression return? {MIN([Order Date])} This expression (also known as table-scoped) is essentially the same as writing : {FIXED : MIN([Order Date])} . This will return the oldest or least Order date, without caring about what the viz level-of-detail is!
Which of the following Grouping techniques results in a new consolidated mark in the view? Grouping by labels
When selected members are combined into a single group, a default name is created using the combined member names.(By default, the new group is named using the combined names of all members.)
Suppose we create a group called G1, and then select the 'Include Others' option. What will this do? When we select this option, all members except the ones in the groups we've created get clubbed in a new group called "Others".
Sets, Top N calculations and Fixed LODs are executed before Dimension Filters

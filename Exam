Tableau can aggregate dimension
blue pill descrete, green pill continuous
When we drag a measure to the view, the aggregation applied by default is NOT always SUM (Whenever you add a measure to your view, an aggregation is applied to that measure by default. The type of aggregation applied varies depending on the context of the view)
We can disaggregate the data, to see all of the marks in the view at the most detailed level of granularity
A bar chart is best used to compare data across categories
Generally, the easiest way to convert a bar chart to a stacked bar chart is to drag a dimension to Color on the marks card
Views with dual axis that has customized marks are called Combo charts
Dual axes are useful for analyzing two measures with different scales
Tableau generates the Latitude and Longitude pills if there are geographic data like 'Country', 'City' etc
Measures names contains the names of all measures in your data, collected into a single field with discrete values
Measures values contains the names of all measures in your data, collected into a single field with continuous values
Filled Maps only make use of color and not size. Symbol maps both Size (manadatory) and color.
Symbol/Filled Maps can apply color based on one measure, and apply Labels using another measure.

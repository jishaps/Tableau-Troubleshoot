How to speed up Tableau workbooks?
Don't work with data you don't needâ€”both in terms of the fields you reference as well as the granularity of the records you return. Use filters, hide unused fields and aggregate. While reducing the data, make sure you use filters efficiently. Strings and dates are slow, numbers and Booleans are fast.

I tried:
*remove unnecessary filters
*use DATE function
Hide Unused fields
Faster: Boolean > Int > Float > String > Date > Datetime
Show Apply Button in filter
Include Values in Filter drop down
Multiple Values (custom list) and Wildcard in filter gives better performance
Continuous date filter is better than Discrete Date
Use chart as a filter (action filter) instead of quick filter
